# Contributing

Welcome to the Eclipse AASX Package Explorer repository. 

If you are joining the project from the previous repository at admin-shell-io/aasx-package-explorer, please see the [Joining Development](#joining-development) section below to get started in the new repository.

The [Contribution guildelines](#contribution-guidelines) section includes general guidelines as well as additional quirks specific to Eclipse Foundation projects, so it is definitely worth a read as well.

## Joining Development

AASX Package Explorer is an Eclipse Foundation incubated project and therefore needs to adhere to Eclipse Foundation rules.
This introduces a slight overhead for every contributor, at least at the very beginning, but it's worth it!

Here are the steps to become a Contributor in Eclipse AASX Package Explorer (and any other project under the Eclipse Foundation umbrella):

1. Create an Eclipse Foundation Account at https://accounts.eclipse.org/ 
1. Log in to your Eclipse account and digitally sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing-eca);
1. Make sure to add your github name (`Edit my account` > `Social Media Links` > `GitHub Username`)
1. Fork the repository and create an initial commit
    - if you have preexisting work that you'd like to include, see TBD
    - ensure that the author credentials on the commit record match the email address and/or GitHub username associated with the Eclipse Foundation Account
1. Create a pull request and work with the project team to merge the contribution
1. Happily develop ever after!
    - or contact a Project Lead or a Committer to be nominated to a Committer yourself (and receive more repository priviledges, such as the ability to merge)

For more details see ["Contributing" in Eclipse Foundation Handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#contributing-contributors).

### How to contribute

Mechanics of how to actually contribute (e.g., merge/pull requests) are described in [AASX Project Explorer Devdoc](https://admin-shell-io.github.io/aasx-package-explorer/devdoc/getting-started/intro.html).

To help you familiarize with the concept of Asset Administration Shell we provide the screencasts (both in English and German) at: https://admin-shell-io.com/screencasts/.

For further information about the Asset Administration Shell, see the publication Details of the Asset Administration Shell by Plattform Industrie 4.0.

We provide a couple of sample admin shells (packaged as .aasx) for you to test and play with the software at: http://www.admin-shell-io.com/samples/
